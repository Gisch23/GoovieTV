  Do you often dont know what to watch? Do you almost ever end
  up watching something stupid on TV or from some Streaming service?
  
  Here is the solution for you!
  
  Watching TV is the definition of "I´m coming home from work and I just want to lay
  down, watch something stupid, have an enormous dinner and go to bed". 
  And that is totaly cool. But lets be honest, TV can´t really satisfy our
  well cultured intelligence. We know that, and therefore we are sometimes
  ready to put the effort in to find something special. Something that tickles
  our desire of art. And thats where GoovieTV comes in. 
  
  Take that time to build your own little archiv of Movies and Series. Gather
  your old DVD collection, and save them to your PC. GoovieTV will allow you
  to easily sort huge amounts of Movie and Series collections, and creating your
  own unique TV Channels with them! Create a Channel for Action Movies, Cartoons,
  Documentations, Christmas time, western, and whatever you can imagine!
